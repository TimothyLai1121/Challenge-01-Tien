1. Type in $\color{#00FF00}{ls}$ to check where you are currently on with terminal.
2. Type in $\color{#00FF00}{cd}$ to navigate to Desktop
3. I used SSH clone method by copying repo ssh links and type in $\color{#00FF00}{git clone}$ along with my links in terminal.
4. Once repo are downloaded, type in $\color{#00FF00}{ls}$ to make sure the files are there and type in $\color{#00FF00}{code~.}$ after to start on your project.
