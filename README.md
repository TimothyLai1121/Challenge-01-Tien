My Challenge 01 - Still in progress


## Introduction
Here are my attempts trying to fix the page that was not responding.

## GitHub Creating Repo & Push
![Step 01 GitHub](/README.md-images/1.png)
1. Type in $\color{#00FF00}{ls}$ to check where you are currently on with terminal.
2. Type in $\color{#00FF00}{cd}$ to navigate to Desktop
3. I used SSH clone method by copying repo ssh links and type in $\color{#00FF00}{git clone}$ along with my links in terminal.
4. Once repo are downloaded, type in $\color{#00FF00}{ls}$ to make sure the files are there and type in $\color{#00FF00}{code~.}$ after to start on your project.


## Git Push

1. Always make sure to type in $\color{#00FF00}{ls}$ to check where you are working on and navigate back to repo folder that you made prior.
2. Type in $\color{#00FF00}{git init}$ to make sure you are in sync.
3. Type in $\color{#00FF00}{code~.}$ to initiate Visual Studio.
4. Type in $\color{#00FF00}{git~status}$ to make sure you are in main. 
5. You can also type in $\color{#00FF00}{git \ checkout \ main}$ to be at main on terminal.
6. If you make changes on your files, you need to type in $\color{#00FF00}{git \ add~ \ -A}$ to add all the adjustment that was made to the files.
7. Make sure you type in '$\color{#00FF00}{git \ commit \ -m \ "your comment here"}$  and add your commit comments inside bracket.
8. Type in $\color{#00FF00}{git~push}$ to push files up into your GitHub Repo.
